## Project Overview

### Motivation
Students in NUS can decide which modules to take up each semester and depending on their own pace, which may differ from their existing peers. Hence, it is difficult to create a new social circle where they are able to carry out effective discussion for each modules quickly. Some may even fear that their questions are too simple, where they may then appear to be less competent. In addition, existing school forums are web-based thus less convenient to access through mobile devices, and notifications to alert about responses to their questions are not available.

We want to create an application where all students can create discussions freely through anonymity, so that everyone can view and learn from each discussion, regardless of whether they have a large social circle in the same module. The application would be built on android platform allowing students to receive notifications for their own posts and tags that that they express interests in, be it module-related or random sharings. Students can also view discussions posted by others to find out perspective that they might not have thought of. 

### Aim
Through this application, we hope that everyone can have a better learning environment by encouraging and amplifying the benefit of having study discussions.
